# X-ray tracer project
X-ray tracer for concave mirrors written in C++ by Nikolay Ivanov.

## compilation:

To compile the program, you need:

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake tools
- Boost libraries with program_options, filesystem and system libraries installed

## features:

- 2D ray-tracing on cyllindrical surfaces
- 3D ray-tracing on spherical surfaces
- 3D ray-tracing on spherical surfaces with surface defects. Surface defects are modelled with spheres.

## yet to be done:

- 3D ray-tracing on elliptical surfaces
